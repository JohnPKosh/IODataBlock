IODataBlock
===========

This is the PublishedPackages directory.

## After every update to the .nuproj Nuget package projects copy build output to this folder!

#### Then when someone pulls down the latest and greatest from GitHub they can copy updates to their local nuget package source directory...

#### You can add a local package source under settings in the Nuget Package Manager of VS. Don't forget to change package source when looking for local packages.
